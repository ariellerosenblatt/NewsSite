For our creative portion, we did multiple things. First, we added little Twitter and Facebook icons with links leading a potential user to be able to share the blog post/website to their followers on either platform. In addition to that, we added a page called "Find Friends!" in which users could find little "pen pals" almost and upload their own email so people could reach out to them. Other user's would have their emails there for anyone to reach out to them. We did this buy creating a new database and attatching the current user's emails to them. We also showed the emails/usernames in a column. Then, we also added another page called "Your Posts", which allows the user to see only what they have posted (including the comments). For the unregistered user, we took away this option, along with the add post feature, as shown in the nav. bar we created. We also made it so you could see who commented what on which post. Also, in the home page, we made it a personalized welcome message to whatever user is logged in as a nice personalized touch.
